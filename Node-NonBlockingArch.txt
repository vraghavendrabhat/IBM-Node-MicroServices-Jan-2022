					Node.js
What is Node.js?

  Node.js is platform and runtime for javascript lang.

Platform: collection of tools
Runtime: Execution engine where javascript can be executed..



Why Node.js?

History of Node.js:

Ryan Dahl who created Node.js.
When he was doing phd in math, who got bored in math , so who
started working on different project by looking the project "flicker" , he was thinking how flicker uploades photos into server.

He attended conference "nginx" conference where who insipred "Non Blocking" Web Server.

He started thinking how to build nginx like server to build web application -  non blocking webservers.

He was thinking how to put java language, but java language was not ready for non blocking computing.Why cant use "javascript", javascript inside browser is non blocking language.

The same time, google published "open source javascript runtime" called v8.

Ryan thought using v8 we can build arch for building non blocking web servers.===>Node.js
..............................................................................................
			Node.js was created to built NonBlocking Network Apps
..............................................................................................

What is Exactly Non Blocking , Blocking? 
  
IO,Threads

What is IO? How IO Works underneeth?


File Descriptor:
................

-FD is a datastructure presented inside os kernal at very low level
-FD is mapper between os and hardware layer
-FD is entry and exit point of os with IO layer
-FD is simple c program.
-FD is broker for io between applications and io os layer

Process:
 File Descriptor is simple c programming, getting loaded into memory once the process inthe
application is started.

Every Process has its own File Descriptor.

Here i have "notepad" - application, when i start notepad , os will create file descriptor in memory.


FD is a table contains information which maps to IO resources

Integer value	Name	<unistd.h> symbolic constant[1]	<stdio.h> file stream[2]
0	Standard input	STDIN_FILENO	stdin
1	Standard output	STDOUT_FILENO	stdout
2	Standard error	STDERR_FILENO	stderr

FD is very simple array.

IO operations and file Descriptors:
....................................

IO opertions can vary from reading data from the keyboard to reading data from disk files and network sockets.

When y read data from the keyboard via FDS it is always done via 0th index of fd.

Use case: 
 I want to read data from the disk file.

if you take any pl, who provides io apis. java.io package and apis 

There are two apis

1.High level api provided by language like java,c,c++..
2.Low level api provided by os - windows,linux,unix,mac....

Flow

Programming language high level api-------> OS low level api------> File Descriptor----|HL

When you read data from file,
